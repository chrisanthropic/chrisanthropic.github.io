**Starving Artist**

I recently built a Wordpress site for a graphic artist friend of mine and I liked how it turned out so I decided to create a Jekyll theme version out of it.

It has custom layouts for blog, about, contact, and gallery pages. The galleries are pinboard-style / Pinterest layout and the **entire** site is Javascript free.

It's also fully compatible with Jekyll's original theming conventions as well as the new Jekyll 3.2 Gem based themes.

So, here it is: [Starving Artist Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/starving-artist-jekyll-theme)

It's released under the MIT license so it's freely available.
