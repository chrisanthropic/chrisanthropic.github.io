## What
[https://github.com/chrisanthropic/terraform-import-github-organization](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/terraform-import-github-organization)

I recently began a project to import an existing Github organization into Terraform to [allow Terraform to control Github user access](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/managing-github-with-terraform). This process involves importing Github Users, Teams, Team Repos, Team Memberships, and Public/Private repos. I looked for a semi-automated process and since I couldn't find one I ended up writing my own fully automated process instead.

It's a simple bash script that uses the Github API and Terraform CLI to import the following Github resources:
- all public repos (includes pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos)
- all private repos (includes pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos)
- all team repos (includes pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos)
- all teams
- all team memberships
- all organization users

After importing the resources the script _also_ writes a basic terraform.tf config for **each resource**.

### Public repos
Imports all public repos owned by the organization (includes full pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos). Also writes a Terraform resource block in a single file (`gihtub-public-repos.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_repository" "$PUBLIC_REPO_NAME" {
  name        = "$PUBLIC_REPO_NAME"
  private     = false
  description = "$PUBLIC_REPO_DESCRIPTION"
  has_wiki    = "$PUBLIC_REPO_WIKI"
  has_downloads = "$PUBLIC_REPO_DOWNLOADS"
  has_issues  = "$PUBLIC_REPO_ISSUES"
}
```

### Private repos
Imports all private repos owned by the organization (includes full pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos). Also writes a Terraform resource block in a single file (`gihtub-private-repos.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_repository" "$PRIVATE_REPO_NAME" {
  name        = "$PRIVATE_REPO_NAME"
  private     = true
  description = "$PRIVATE_REPO_DESCRIPTION"
  has_wiki    = "$PRIVATE_REPO_WIKI"
  has_downloads = "$PRIVATE_REPO_DOWNLOADS"
  has_issues  = "$PRIVATE_REPO_ISSUES"
}
```

### Team repos
Imports all team repos owned by the organization (includes full pagination support for Orgs with 100+ repos). Also writes a Terraform resource block in a unique file per team (`gihtub-teams-$TEAM_NAME.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_team_repository" "$TEAM_NAME-$TERRAFORM_TEAM_REPO_NAME" {
  team_id    = "$TEAM_ID"
  repository = "$REPO_NAME"
  permission = "admin" or "push" or "pull"
}
```

### Teams
Imports all teams belonging to the organization. Also writes a Terraform resource block in a unique file per team (`gihtub-teams-$TEAM_NAME.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_team" "$TEAM_NAME" {
  name        = "$TEAM_NAME"
  description = "$TEAM_DESCRIPTION"
  privacy     = "closed" or "secret"
}
```

### Team memberships
Imports the team membership for all teams owned by the organization (what users belong to what teams). Also writes a Terraform resource block in a unique file per team (`gihtub-team-memberships-$TEAM_NAME.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_team_membership" "$TEAM_NAME-$USER_NAME" {
  username    = "$USER_NAME"
  team_id     = "$TEAM_ID"
  role        = "maintainer" or "member"
}
```

### Organization users
Imports all users belonging to the organization. Also writes a Terraform resource block in a single file (`gihtub-users.tf`), using the following template and populating it with values pulled via the Github API:

```
resource "github_membership" "$USER_NAME" {
  username        = "$USER_NAME"
  role            = "member"
}
```

## How to use the script
### Requirements
- An existing Github account with a user that belongs to an organization
- A github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) with the following permissions:
  - repo (all)
  - admin:org (all)
  - delete_repo
- Terraform
- jq

### Do it
- `git clone` this repo
- configure the variables at the top of the script
  - GITHUB_TOKEN=''
  - ORG=''
- run the script
- run a terraform plan to see that everything was imported and that no changes are required.
  - some manual modifications _could_ be required since not every field supported by Terraform has been implemented by this script.

### CI
I'm considering wiring this up to Travis-CI so that developers can use the Github UI to create teams/repos/etc and then when a PR is merged this script will run to create a new PR containing any updates or modifications to teams/users/repos. This would allow for easy developer flow while still giving us the benefit of infra-as-code and version controlling our user access.

## Wrap-up
I think it'd be a good idea to include support for all fields that Terraform offers, this mostly affects repos since there's a good deal of configuration that can happen there.

In the long long long term I'd love to see more Terraform resources implemented so we could begin some cool Terraform import automation tooling and pipelines.
