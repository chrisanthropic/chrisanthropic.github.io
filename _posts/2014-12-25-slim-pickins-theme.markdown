**Slim Pickens**

All the previous posts have been documenting the steps and research for creating what I consider to be a simple yet fully featured Jekyll site.

Now that I'm done, I've compiled all of it into what I'm calling a Jekyll theming framework. That's probably wrong and I'm sure someone will get pissed about it...

What I mean is that it is only lightly themed, easily configurable via Sass variables, the Zurb grid, and Jekyll's Data feature. It's meant to make prototyping new themes a quick task.

So, here it is: [Slim Pickins Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/slim-pickins-jekyll-theme)

It's released under a custom license that says 1) Use it in any way you want, 2) Don't hold me responsible for how you use it.
